Pixsaw
======

Cuts an image up into multiple pieces by following pixel lines that contrast
with targetted piece color.  Inspired by scissors, but more flexible with the
drawback of possibly losing some pixels in the process.

Installing
----------

Depends on:

To be determined...


Installing with buildout is easiest after getting a bootstrap.py file.

python2.7 path/to/bootstrap.py

./bin/buildout

Usage
-----

After installing, a 'pixsaw' script will be in the bin directory.  Running that
will show some help.  It basically needs a path to a directory to store the
generated files, an image that shows where to cut, and the image that should be
cut into pieces.
